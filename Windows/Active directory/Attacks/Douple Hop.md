### invoke command
```powershell
$cred = Get-Credential lol\pixel
Invoke-Command -ComputerName normal -Credential $cred -ScriptBlock {
    Invoke-Command -ComputerName normal2 -Credential $Using:cred -ScriptBlock {hostname}
}
```

## PortProxy

Since we have Local Administrator on the intermediate target **bizintel: 10.35.8.17**, you can add a port forwarding rule to send your requests to the final/third server **secdev: 10.35.8.23**.

Can quickly use **netsh** to rip out a one-liner and add the rule.

```
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=5446 listenaddress=10.35.8.17 connectport=5985 connectaddress=10.35.8.23
```
So **bizintel** is listening on port 5446 and will forward requests hitting 5446 off to **secdev** port 5985 (aka WinRM).

## Workaround #1: PSCredential Object (Non-domain joined)
```bash
$SecPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString '!qazXSW@' -AsPlainText -Force

$Cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential('INLANEFREIGHT\backupadm', $SecPassword)

#now we load it, $cred is important
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\backupadm\Documents> import-module .\PowerView.ps1
get-domainuser -spn -credential $Cred | select samaccountname

```

## Workaround #2: Register PSSession Configuration (domain joined)
We've seen what we can do to overcome this problem when using a tool such as `evil-winrm` to connect to a host via WinRM. What if we're on a domain-joined host and can connect remotely to another using WinRM? Or we are working from a Windows attack host and connect to our target via WinRM using the [Enter-PSSession cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/enter-pssession?view=powershell-7.2)? Here we have another option to change our setup to be able to interact directly with the DC or other hosts/resources without having to set up a PSCredential object and include credentials along with every command (which may not be an option with some tools).

Let's start by first establishing a WinRM session on the remote host.
```powershell
PS C:\htb> Enter-PSSession -ComputerName ACADEMY-AEN-DEV01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL -Credential inlanefreight\backupadm
```
If we check for cached tickets using `klist`, we'll see that the same problem exists. Due to the double hop problem, we can only interact with resources in our current session but cannot access the DC directly using PowerView. We can see that our current TGS is good for accessing the HTTP service on the target since we connected over WinRM, which uses SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) requests in XML format to communicate over HTTP, so it makes sense.

We also cannot interact directly with the DC using PowerView

One trick we can use here is registering a new session configuration using the [Register-PSSessionConfiguration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/register-pssessionconfiguration?view=powershell-7.2) cmdlet.
```powershell
PS C:\htb> Register-PSSessionConfiguration -Name backupadmsess -RunAsCredential inlanefreight\backupadm

 WARNING: When RunAs is enabled in a Windows PowerShell session configuration, the Windows security model cannot enforce
 a security boundary between different user sessions that are created by using this endpoint. Verify that the Windows
PowerShell runspace configuration is restricted to only the necessary set of cmdlets and capabilities.
WARNING: Register-PSSessionConfiguration may need to restart the WinRM service if a configuration using this name has
recently been unregistered, certain system data structures may still be cached. In that case, a restart of WinRM may be
 required.
All WinRM sessions connected to Windows PowerShell session configurations, such as Microsoft.PowerShell and session
configurations that are created with the Register-PSSessionConfiguration cmdlet, are disconnected.

   WSManConfig: Microsoft.WSMan.Management\WSMan::localhost\Plugin

Type            Keys                                Name
----            ----                                ----
Container       {Name=backupadmsess}                backupadmsess
```
Once this is done, we need to restart the WinRM service by typing `Restart-Service WinRM` in our current PSSession. This will kick us out, so we'll start a new PSSession using the named registered session we set up previously.

After we start the session, we can see that the double hop problem has been eliminated, and if we type `klist`, we'll have the cached tickets necessary to reach the Domain Controller. This works because our local machine will now impersonate the remote machine in the context of the `backupadm` user and all requests from our local machine will be sent directly to the Domain Controller.
```powershell
PS C:\htb> Enter-PSSession -ComputerName DEV01 -Credential INLANEFREIGHT\backupadm -ConfigurationName  backupadmsess
[DEV01]: PS C:\Users\backupadm\Documents> klist

Current LogonId is 0:0x2239ba

       Session Key Type: AES-256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96
       Cache Flags: 0x1 -> PRIMARY
       Kdc Called: DC01
```
We can now run tools such as PowerView without having to create a new PSCredential object.

>Note: We cannot use `Register-PSSessionConfiguration` from an evil-winrm shell because we won't be able to get the credentials popup. Furthermore, if we try to run this by first setting up a PSCredential object and then attempting to run the command by passing credentials like `-RunAsCredential $Cred`, we will get an error because we can only use `RunAs` from an elevated PowerShell terminal. Therefore, this method will not work via an evil-winrm session as it requires GUI access and a proper PowerShell console. Furthermore, in our testing, we could not get this method to work from PowerShell on a Parrot or Ubuntu attack host due to certain limitations on how PowerShell on Linux works with Kerberos credentials. This method is still highly effective if we are testing from a Windows attack host and have a set of credentials or compromise a host and can connect via RDP to use it as a "jump host" to mount further attacks against hosts in the environment. .
